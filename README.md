# Pozyx-Positioner

This repository contains code and documentation for implementing indoor positioning using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology with a Pozyx positioner and Clearpath Husky robot.

UWB is a wireless communication technology that allows for high-accuracy, low-latency indoor positioning. Pozyx is a UWB-based positioning system that provides precise indoor positioning information. The Clearpath Husky is a rugged, all-terrain robot that is well-suited for indoor and outdoor applications.

This project combines these technologies to create a robust indoor positioning system that can be used for a variety of applications, such as warehouse automation, autonomous navigation, and more.
